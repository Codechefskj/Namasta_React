1) Is JSX mandatory for React?
ans) no JSX is not mandotary for react .. JSX i sjust like syntak which make .createElemnt easy way to written 

2)Is ES6 mandatory for React?
ans) No ES6 is not mandatory for react . react itself does't depend on ES6 it can used with ES6 or older 

3) what is ES6 ?
ans) ES6 was major update to JS , introducing feature like let,const,arrow function , classes , templete literals , promises and more 

4)How can I write comments in JSX?
ans) we used "//" for single line comments and "**/" for multiple line 

5)What is Virtual DOM?
ans) VDOM is lightweight copy or representation of real DOM that exist is memory rather than browser (this is a just copy of real DOM)
     in typical react application the virtual DOM act an intermediate between the UI state and real DOM . when somethings change in real DOM , react will update the virtual DOM first 

6) what is shadow DOM  ? how it is diffrent for virtual dom ?
ans) The shadow dom is browser technology designed primarily for scoping variable and css in web components . virtual DOM is concepy implementa by libraries in JS 

7)What is Reconciliation in React?
ans) it is process of updating the real DOM based in changes in virtual DOM . react uses highly optimizes algorithum (DIFFER) to compare the current virtual DOM with previous one the figure 
     out the minimum set of changes ("differ") required update the real DOM . this process ensure that react only update the nessasary part of uI , improving performance and  avoidable unnessary re-render 

8)What is React Fiber?
ans) a reimplementation of React's core algorithm that improves the performance of React applications
     the goal of react fibre is to increase its siutablity for area like animation , layout  and gesture 
     features are :
     1) incremental rendering : the ablity to split rendering work chunks(large peices) and spread out over multiple frames 
     2) the ablity to pause , abort or reuse work as new update come in the ability to assign pririty to diffrent types of update 

9)Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
ans)key help react to identify which iteam have changes are added or are remove ... suppose we have 4 div and then we add one more div in virual dom . the added div lies on first place then other dom are present after that . if we dont have key the diffre algorithum rendering everthing then commit change into real DOM that's why we give unique key over there
    no key << index key << uniquly key 

10) Can we use index as keys in React?
ans) yes we can used the index of array or map in react , but it not recommendated to used this because :
     1) incorrect components matching : react used key yo identify which element has to chnged been added or rendering if the order of iteam change using and index can cause react to mis match element , leading to unexpected error
